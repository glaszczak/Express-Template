# Revised Application Architecture Overview

This document outlines the structure and architecture of a template application developed with `Node.js`, utilizing `TypeScript` for strong typing and `TypeDI` for dependency injection. The application is designed with modern software architecture practices in mind, integrating with stored procedures in a database and avoiding typical database access methods within the application itself. It emphasizes a modular, scalable approach suitable for microservices architecture and implements several key patterns and technologies.

## Node.js and TypeScript

The application is built `on Node.js`, leveraging `TypeScript` to provide static typing. This combination enhances code quality and maintainability, offering a robust foundation for building scalable and efficient software solutions. The use of `TypeScript`, in particular, facilitates development by catching errors early through static type checking.

## Dependency Injection with TypeDI

`TypeDI` is utilized for dependency injection, promoting a loosely-coupled architecture that improves the modularity and testability of the application. By managing dependencies centrally, `TypeDI` aids in the creation of maintainable and scalable software designs.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The application's architecture reflects a strong commitment to `Domain-Driven Design`, centralizing business logic within the domain layer. This layer encapsulates the application's core functionalities and models, promoting a clear separation between the system's business logic and its technical infrastructure.

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

The architecture adopts the `CQRS pattern`, distinguishing between command handling for state mutations and query handling for state retrieval. This separation enhances the application's scalability and maintainability by clearly dividing the read and write operations.

## Microservices and Asynchronous Communication

### RabbitMQ Integration

The application utilizes `RabbitMQ` for asynchronous message-based communication between different components or microservices. It employs a topic exchange approach, setting up queues and binding them with routing keys to facilitate flexible message routing based on multiple criteria. This method allows for the dynamic distribution of messages and enables the application to efficiently handle various types of workloads with different processing requirements.

### Database Connectivity

The application establishes a connection with a `MySQL` database, leveraging it for data persistence. The interaction with the database is carried out through stored procedures, aligning with the application's strategy to encapsulate database logic and ensure a clean separation from the application layer.

## Health Check Endpoint

The application includes a health check endpoint, providing real-time insights into the health status of its critical components, such as MySQL and RabbitMQ. This endpoint returns the health status of these components, allowing for immediate diagnosis and troubleshooting of potential issues. This feature is vital for maintaining the application's reliability and availability in a production environment.
