# Application Documentation

Welcome to the main documentation of the application. This README provides a structured overview of all available documentation resources.

This `Node.js` application template, using `TypeScript` and `TypeDI`, is designed with scalability, security, and code quality at its forefront. By leveraging patterns such as `DDD` and `CQRS`, and technologies like `RabbitMQ` for message queuing and `MySQL` for database interaction, the architecture ensures a robust foundation for developing modern, maintainable, and efficient software solutions.
